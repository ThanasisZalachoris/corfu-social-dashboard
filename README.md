# Tourism Strain Index (TSI) — MVP (2025)

A data-driven dashboard for visualizing overtourism and urban pressure indicators on the island of Corfu, Greece. Built to support local planning efforts through real-time, location-based intelligence.

## 📏 Overview
This MVP demonstrates a prototype version of a regional analytics platform that captures the invisible pressure tourism exerts on infrastructure, services, and digital readiness across Corfu.

- **Focus Area:** Island of Corfu, Greece
- **Current Version:** MVP / Demo (private preview)
- **Primary Audience:** Regional planners, tourism analysts, urban resilience researchers

## 🔧 Built With
- **Streamlit** – for lightweight, interactive dashboard development
- **Python** – data processing & visualization
- **Custom Datasets** – manually collected local indicators (no APIs yet)

## 📊 Indicators & Metrics
- **Tourist Saturation Index** (TSI): Relative ratio of tourists to resident population.
- **Digital Readiness Index**: Local internet speed, coverage, digital tools
- **Urban Pressure Index**: Visitor mobility, traffic proxies, public resource use
- **Population Flow Metrics**: Night-stay estimations, temporal concentration

## 🔹 Current Features
- Clean UI with three main indicators
- Sidebar navigation with explanations
- First-level data simulations using real-world assumptions
- Watermarked preview images

## 🌐 Project Demo
_(Private preview only — deployment coming soon)_

## ✏️ Conceptual Design
This tool reflects a need to rethink how local and regional tourism pressure is quantified. Rather than aggregate visitor numbers alone, the TSI framework seeks to:
- Represent the spatial and temporal footprint of tourism
- Offer early-warning signals for overtourism effects
- Inform smarter, more sustainable destination management
